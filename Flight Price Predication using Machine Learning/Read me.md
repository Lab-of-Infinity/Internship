	FLIGHT PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT

Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary. The cheapest 
available ticket on a given flight gets more and less expensive over time. This usually happens as 
an attempt to maximize revenue based on -
1. Time of purchase patterns (making sure last-minute purchases are expensive)
2. Keeping the flight as full as they want it (raising prices on a flight which is filling up in order 
to reduce sales and hold back inventory for those expensive last-minute expensive 
purchases)
So, you have to work on a project where you collect data of flight fares with other features and 
work to make a model to predict fares of flights.

STEPS

	1. Data Collection :
You have to scrape at least 1500 rows of data. You can scrape more data as well, it’s up to you, 
More the data better the model
In this section you have to scrape the data of flights from different websites (yatra.com, 
skyscanner.com, official websites of airlines, etc). The number of columns for data doesn’t have 
limit, it’s up to you and your creativity. Generally, these columns areairline name, date of journey, 
source, destination, route, departure time, arrival time, duration, total stops and the target variable 
price. You can make changes to it, you can add or you can remove some columns, it completely
depends on the website from which you are fetching the data.

	2. Data Analysis :
After cleaning the data, you have to do some analysis on the data. 
Do airfares change frequently? Do they move in small increments or in large jumps? Do they tend 
to go up or down over time?
What is the best time to buy so that the consumer can save the most by taking the least risk?
Does price increase as we get near to departure date? Is Indigo cheaper than Jet Airways? Are 
morning flights expensive?

	3. Model Building :
After collecting the data, you need to build a machine learning model. Before model building do 
all data pre-processing steps. Try different models with different hyper parameters and select 
the bestmodel.

Follow the complete life cycle of data science. Include all the steps like
		
		1. Data Cleaning
		2. Exploratory Data Analysis
		3. Data Pre-processing
		4. Model Building
		5. Model Evaluation
		6. Selecting the best model
