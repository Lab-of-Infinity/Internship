Houses are one of the necessary need of each and every person around the globe and therefore housing and real estate 
market is one of the markets which is one of the major contributors in the world’s economy. It is a very large market 
and there are various companies working in the domain. Data science comes as a very important tool to solve problems 
in the domain to help the companies increase their overall revenue, profits, improving their marketing strategies and 
focusing on changing trends in house sales and purchases. Predictive modelling, Market mix modelling, 
recommendation systems are some of the machine learning techniques used for achieving the business goals for housing 
companies. Our problem is related to one such housing company.
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses 
data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. For the same 
purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file 
below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy houses to enter the market. You are required to build a model 
using Machine Learning in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest 
in them or not. For this company wants to know:
• Which variables are important to predict the price of variable?
• How do these variables describe the price of the house?
Business Goal:
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used 
by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the 
strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for the 
management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
